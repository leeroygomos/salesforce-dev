                    <h3>FitnessBuddy</h3>
                    <p><a href="https://ancient-sierra-47830.herokuapp.com">A fitness web application</a> developed using NodeJS and Heroku.
                        Key features include finding nearby gyms, nutrition
                        facts, exercises search for different muscles, and a realtime
                        chatroom.

                    <h3>Voluntutor</h3>
                    <p>A tutoring web application which used AWS Elastic Beanstalk for deployment and was developed
                        using Python with Django as the web framework. It also used Amazon RDS for PostgreSQL as the
                        database engine and Amazon S3 cloud storage for static files.

                    <h3>Calculations App</h3>
                    <p>A web application that calculates fibonacci, factorial, exponents, quadratic formula, and pythagorean
                        theorem. It also does numeric conversions between decimal, hexadecimal, and binary. Developed using
                        Django, C/C++, and Go.

                    <h3>Satisfiability Problem Solver</h3>
                    <p>A Python program that implements the DPLL algorithm to check
                        the satisfiability of an expression in Conjunctive Normal Form (CNF).
                        It may also print a list of true literals if the expression is satisfiable.

                    <h3>Basic Linux Shell</h3>
                    <p>An implementation of the Linux shell using C with additional commands: !n, type, and history.
                        The commands pwd, exit, and cd were also reimplemented.

                    <p>Implementations of the depth-first, breadth-first, and A* search algorithms using the
                        Pac-Man game to visualize the results. Python is used to write the program, and the assignment was
                        originally adapted from <a href="http://ai.berkeley.edu/project_overview.html">UC Berkeley's Pacman AI projects</a>.
